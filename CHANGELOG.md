# Changelog

All notable changes to candor-java are recorded here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); candor-java is pre-1.0, so minor versions may
include behavioural changes (always in the soundness-increasing direction — the §4 trust contract).
**⚠ marks a verdict-affecting change** — a gate/guard/report that was green may read differently
after upgrading; review policies and regenerate baselines with the new build.

## [0.8.15] — 2026-07-11

### ✨ Gate scans auto-disclose the provable-purity gap (no need to know to run `unverified`)

A policy scan now emits the `unverified` disclosure automatically as a stderr note: after the gate verdict,
any method in a `pure`/`deny <E>` scope that PASSES but is `Unknown` (an unresolvable call — the classic
fn/closure-injected "port", e.g. a `LongSupplier` domain) is named, with the `deny <E> Unknown <scope>` upgrade
that makes the layer PROVABLY clean. Closes the discovery gap — an author learns their "pure" layer isn't
*provably* pure without knowing the `unverified` command exists. **Advisory only**: a note, never a violation,
so the exit code, gate verdict, and `--gate-json` are untouched. Emitted from `Policy.checkPolicy` after the
AS-EFF-006 loop. Mirrors candor-scan/ts/swift (four-engine parity). Existing gate/smoke tests unchanged.

## [0.8.14] — 2026-07-11

### ✨ `unverified` — the provable-purity disclosure ported here (four-engine parity)

Ports candor-query's `unverified` (candor-query 0.8.10): a `pure`/`deny <E>` layer PASSES a function that has
no such effect — but if that function is `Unknown` (an unresolvable call, e.g. a fn/closure-injected port), the
pass is UNVERIFIED. Discloses each such function in a governed layer + the `deny <E> Unknown <scope>` upgrade
that makes the layer PROVABLY clean. `--strict` → exit 1. JSON `{ok, unverified[]}`. Byte-for-byte the same
disclosure as the other engines, pinned four-way by conformance PART 12c. Read-only; gate verdict untouched.

## [0.8.13] — 2026-07-11

### `fix`: the no-clean-hoist advice names the port purity hierarchy (soundness investigation)

Following the fix-loop eval's finding that models reach for a TRAIT port (which candor's gate rejects — it
resolves the dispatch back to the effect-performing impl), an empirical investigation (eval/fixloop/DISPATCH-
NOTE.md) confirmed candor's behaviour is CORRECT (accepting a trait port would silently under-report the effect
the layer reaches at runtime — the cardinal sin), and pinned the three fix shapes' distinct classifications:
trait dispatch → the effect (resolved); fn/closure value → Unknown; plain data → pure. The no-clean-hoist
advice now names the hierarchy: (a) hoist + thread DATA = provably pure (recommended); (b) fn/closure injection
clears `deny E` but leaves an Unknown hole a `deny E Unknown` policy would flag; (c) a trait port doesn't clear
the gate. Text-only; no gate change (the resolution is sound). A candor-scan test guards the classification.

## [0.8.12] — 2026-07-11

### `fix`: no-clean-hoist advice rewritten (eval-driven — the remedy was steering agents wrong)

The fix-loop eval (candor-rust/eval/fixloop) measured that on the no-clean-hoist case candor's remedy did NOT
help and HURT weaker models (fable 60% vs control 100%): agents followed the literal "introduce a PORT (a
trait)" advice and wrote a trait port, which candor's OWN gate then rejected — it resolves the trait dispatch
back to the effect-performing impl, so the layer still violates. And "NO CLEAN HOIST" was computed on the
existing graph, so it wrongly declared impossible the simplest valid fix (add a thin composition root above
the layer). The advice now (a) LEADS with the composition-root hoist, and (b) recommends fn/closure injection
with candor's trait-dispatch caveat ("a trait port whose impl performs the effect still trips the gate").
Text-only (the cut/JSON is unchanged; conformance PART 12b still MATCHES). Re-running the eval: the fixed
remedy recovers the treatment arm to 100% across all four models (fable 60% → 100%). See eval/fixloop/RESULTS.md.

## [0.8.11] — 2026-07-11

### `fix`: the sandwiched-layer case is now handled (last correctness gap closed)

When an ALLOWED layer is CALLED BY a forbidden one (`D1 → A → D2 → site`, deny on the D layer), hoisting the
effect to the nearest allowed frontier `A` would leave `D1` still inheriting it. `cleanHoist` is now `false`
in that case (a forbidden fn calls into the frontier), with a message that names the sandwich and offers the
port/relax options — instead of a misleading "hoist to A". Detected in the same upward climb that gathers
`hoistHigher`; identical across all four engines, pinned four-way by conformance PART 12b's sandwiched
sub-check. Read-only; additive.

## [0.8.10] — 2026-07-11

### `fix`: cross-engine parity fixes (from a high-effort /code-review)

- **Start resolution** now prefers a name match that PERFORMS the effect (so `fix save Net` resolves to the
  effectful `Repo.save`, not a pure `Cache.save`) — matching the other engines; previously a false "nothing
  to hoist" all-clear was possible.
- **Inline-`calls` fallback**: when the `.callgraph.json` sidecar is absent (stdout report, hand-authored,
  cleaned), `fix`/`fix-gate` now fall back to the report entries' inline `calls` (via the new `fixGraph`
  helper) instead of computing over an empty graph and emitting a degenerate "no clean hoist" — matching
  candor-query/swift and the sibling `callers` command.
- **`byName`-absent caller** in the up-walk is now skipped (a pure callgraph-only node never routes the
  effect), matching candor-swift.

## [0.8.9] — 2026-07-11

### `fix`/`fix-gate`: the higher-hoist trade-off (FIX-SPEC's last refinement)

Each remedy gains `hoistHigher` beside `hoistTo`: the allowed-layer transitive callers of the minimal
frontier that also route the effect — the places you could originate it *further up*. The text surfaces the
trade-off (hoisting higher keeps the frontier pure too, threading through more signatures). `hoistTo` (the
minimal fix) is unchanged. Byte-for-byte identical to candor-query/ts/swift, pinned by conformance PART 12b.
Read-only, additive; no report/verdict change.

## [0.8.8] — 2026-07-11

### ✨ `fix` / `fix-gate` — the boundary fix reaches the JVM reference engine (FIX-SPEC P3)

The remedial capability shipped in candor-query (candor fix) now has a native candor-java port — the
reference engine, where the layer model is richest. When a method performs an effect its architecture layer
forbids, `fix <report> <method> <Effect> [policy]` computes the *architectural remedy*: the direct call site
to hoist, the forbidden-layer methods that become pure and thread the value, and the nearest allowed-layer
caller to perform the effect — plus the policy-relax alternative. `fix-gate <report> [policy]` does it for
every deny/`pure` (AS-EFF-006) crossing at once, collapsing the inheritors of one root cause to a single
plan. Text or `--json`. Byte-for-byte the same remedy shape as candor-query, verified on real JVM bytecode.

The cut is **site-anchored**: it walks *up* from the direct effect site through the denied layer, so the
pure span is the same regardless of which inheriting method triggered it (root-independent) — the two domain
methods of a crossing collapse to one identical remedy. `integrations/claude-code/candor-review.sh` (the JVM
edit-time loop) now folds the plan into the block message: on an AS-EFF gate failure with a policy set, it
calls `$CANDOR fix-gate` and appends the remedy under the finding, so the agent self-corrects toward the
right architecture. Read-only, no report-byte or verdict change; advisory (the gate re-scan stays the ground
truth). Six tests in `FixGateTest` pin the collapse, the single-method cut, the clean case, and the
fail-loud policy contracts.

## [0.8.7] — 2026-07-10

Documentation-and-identity release; no report-byte or verdict changes.

- The embedded agent contract (AGENTS.md, served by `--agents`) now documents `--gate-json`,
  `.candor/config`, the $-scope-segment rule, pure-vs-Unknown, and the diff/gains exit contract;
  version examples became placeholders so they cannot drift.
- README: candor-java correctly self-identifies as the family's reference engine (the header
  wrongly deferred to a "Rust reference"); install block hoisted to the first screen; smoke gains
  five identity drift-gates (incl. a ban on the string "Rust reference").
- Tests renamed by feature (KappaBatch24/28-31 → Hibernate/LegacyEnterprise/Utility/Jackson/LongTail
  — provenance kept in javadocs); the fabrication probe's header follows the family cardinal-sin
  ruling (the silent under-report owns the term).

## [0.8.6] — 2026-07-09

- ⚠ **Policy scope segments now split on the `$` nested-type boundary** (the family §6.2 ruling,
  matching the query name ladder): `deny Net client` / `forbid app -> repo` now bite JVM nested
  classes (`Outer$client`). A scope name that previously matched only packages may now match
  nested types — review policies on upgrade.
- ⚠ **`CANDOR_STRICT` gate fix (AS-EFF-001/002/003)**: `checkConformance` lacked SPEC §6's
  program-entry-point exemption, so AS-EFF-001 fired on the composition root (`main` legitimately
  mints the capability bundle). Found by the first-ever coverage measurement — the gate had zero
  test coverage in any harness; it now has 12 JUnit pins + a smoke section.
- ⚠ **`diff`/`gains` exit parity**: `diff` exits 1 on a gained effect when baseline/engine
  producing versions match (a mismatch discloses and exits 0), matching candor-ts.
- **Structural — byte-identical** (996-file corpus-proven, *not* verdict-affecting): `analyze()`
  decomposed into per-instruction-kind handlers with explicit context threading; rule tables in
  `Rules.java`; one `TestCompiler`; review-round test files renamed by feature; dead code removed.
- Coverage-wave pins: taint at control-flow joins, ~500 classifier table rows with
  anti-fabrication twins, `--help`/`--version`, stdout report purity, hostile dep-report shapes.

## [0.8.5] — 2026-07-09

- ⚠ **Fail-closed sweep** — previously-green failure paths now exit 2 (intentional): an unwritable
  `--gate-json` verdict path fails the run; a `CANDOR_DEPS` entry naming no readable file, an
  unwalkable deps dir, or an unparseable dep report fails the run (was: every call into the dep
  silently read pure); an unwritable `--json` report path prints one diagnostic line and exits 2.
- **Performance**: the classifier's single ~27KB method exceeded HotSpot's JIT limit, so the
  hottest path in every scan ran interpreted; now a per-package dispatch — verified
  **byte-identical** by a 19.5M-triple differential oracle plus a 330-jar corpus; ~16% faster
  full-corpus scans.
- **Spec §2.1 / §3.4 parity**: `diff`/`gains` disclose a producing-version mismatch
  (`baseline_version`/`engine_version` + a stderr warning) and still answer; relative
  `.candor/config` values resolve against the config's home directory, never the CWD; the CWD
  discovery fallback is gone.
- Tests/CI: `--parallel` smoke coverage; report/verdict schema-shape tests; the kappa_libs +
  mutation probes run weekly (the mutation probe had rotted to 3/14 — re-anchored, 14/14).
  Conformance: all 16 cross-engine parts MATCH.

## [0.8.4] — 2026-07-08

- ⚠ **Soundness patch — six cardinal-sin regressions in 0.8.3's κ batches 28–31** (found by a
  high-effort code review; 0.8.3 users should upgrade). Fabrications removed (false effect on pure
  code): AWS `AmazonS3URI` accessors, Redisson pure members, commons-io pure path helpers, jjwt
  no-arg `parser()` factories, `StopWatch.create()`. Silent-pure removed: the blanket
  `com.amazonaws` coverage grant silenced unmodeled v1 facades (`DynamoDBMapper.save` read pure) —
  unmodeled AWS/commons-io members now disclose `invisible`.
- ⚠ **Baseline guard fail-closed**: a corrupt/unparseable baseline now fails the run (exit 2)
  instead of silently disabling the guard.
- Every fix has an anti-fabrication test twin; jsoup/gson reports byte-identical to 0.8.3 (the
  carve-outs only move the buggy members).
